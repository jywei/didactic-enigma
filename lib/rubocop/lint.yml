# Allow safe assignment in conditions.
Lint/AssignmentInCondition:
  AllowSafeAssignment: true

# checks whether the end keywords are aligned properly for `do` `end` blocks.
Lint/BlockAlignment:
  # The value `start_of_block` means that the `end` should be aligned with line
  # where the `do` keyword appears.
  # The value `start_of_line` means it should be aligned with the whole
  # expression's starting line.
  # The value `either` means both are allowed.
  AlignWith: either
  SupportedStyles:
    - either
    - start_of_block
    - start_of_line

# Align ends correctly.
Lint/EndAlignment:
  # The value `keyword` means that `end` should be aligned with the matching
  # keyword (if, while, etc.).
  # The value `variable` means that in assignments, `end` should be aligned
  # with the start of the variable on the left hand side of `=`. In all other
  # situations, `end` should still be aligned with the keyword.
  # The value `start_of_line` means that `end` should be aligned with the start
  # of the line which the matching keyword appears on.
  AlignWith: keyword
  SupportedStyles:
    - keyword
    - variable
    - start_of_line
  AutoCorrect: false

Lint/DefEndAlignment:
  # The value `def` means that `end` should be aligned with the def keyword.
  # The value `start_of_line` means that `end` should be aligned with method
  # calls like `private`, `public`, etc, if present in front of the `def`
  # keyword on the same line.
  AlignWith: start_of_line
  SupportedStyles:
    - start_of_line
    - def
